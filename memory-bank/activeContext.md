   - Designed system tray states and menu structure
   - Outlined calendar integration with EventKit and cloud calendars

2. Task Creation Session (2025-05-23)
   - Created 5 transcription enhancement tasks:
     - TASK011: Concurrent Transcriptions
     - TASK012: Fix Transcription Progress  
     - TASK013: Update Recording List UI (new design with AI titles)
     - TASK014: Import External Recordings
     - TASK015: OpenAI Speech-to-Text Integration
   - Updated tasks index with all new pending tasks
   - Documented comprehensive implementation plans for each task

3. Recordings List UI Implementation (2025-05-23)
   - Created sidebar UI components:
     - Sidebar: Collapsible container with toggle button
     - RecordingsList: Fetches and displays all recordings
     - RecordingItem: Individual recording display with metadata
   - Implemented date grouping:
     - Today, Yesterday, This Week, This Month, Older
     - Relative time display for recent recordings
   - Added real-time updates:
     - IPC event system for recording completion
     - Manual callback as fallback
     - Automatic list refresh when new recordings are created
   - Styled with CSS modules and consistent design

### Active Decisions
1. Meeting Recording Architecture
   - **System Audio**: Use macOS ScreenCaptureKit API for system audio capture
   - **Dual Recording**: Combine system audio + microphone in synchronized recording
   - **Detection Method**: Audio activity monitoring + user confirmation prompts
   - **Smart Integration**: Calendar-aware meeting prediction and auto-naming

2. System Tray Design
   - **Status States**: Gray (idle), Yellow (detected), Red (recording), Green (processing), Blue (meeting mode)
   - **Quick Actions**: Start/stop recording, meeting mode toggle, open main window
   - **Live Updates**: Recording timer display in tray menu

3. Calendar Integration Strategy
   - **Primary**: macOS EventKit for native calendar access
   - **Extended**: Google Calendar and Outlook/Exchange APIs
   - **Privacy-First**: Local calendar data processing, user permission controls
   - **Smart Features**: Pre-meeting alerts, automatic recording naming, attendee metadata

4. Recording Architecture
   - Moved recording to renderer process for browser API access
   - Using MediaRecorder + Web Audio API dual-path
   - Streaming audio chunks to main process
   - WebM/Opus format for recordings

5. Storage Strategy
   - Base path: ~/Documents/VoiceMCP/
   - Organization: recordings/YYYY/MM-MonthName/
   - File naming: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_[uuid].webm
   - SQLite database for metadata

### Next Steps
