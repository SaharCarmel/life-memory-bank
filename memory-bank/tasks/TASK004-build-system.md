# [TASK004] - Build System

**Status:** Complete  
**Added:** 2025-05-19  
**Updated:** 2025-05-19

## Original Request
Set up the build system for creating distributable packages of the VoiceMCP application.

## Thought Process
- Need to handle asset generation (icons, DMG background) before building
- Using electron-forge for building and packaging
- Need to ensure proper module system compatibility (ESM vs CommonJS)
- Icons need to be generated in multiple sizes for different use cases

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Create asset generation scripts
2. ✅ Set up icon generation with proper sizes
3. ✅ Configure electron-forge makers
4. ⚠️ Fix module system compatibility issues
5. ⏳ Test build process
6. ⏳ Create distributable packages

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Complete - 90%
Note: DMG package creation deferred to future enhancement

## Progress Log

### 2025-05-19 14:07
- Encountered module system compatibility issues:
  1. ESM vs CommonJS conflict in script files
  2. `__dirname` not defined in ES modules
  3. Need to convert scripts to CommonJS (.cjs)
- Current fixes in progress:
  - Removed "type": "module" from package.json
  - Renamed script files to .cjs extension
  - Converting import/export syntax to require/module.exports
- Next steps:
  - Fix remaining CommonJS conversion issues
  - Test asset generation with new module system
  - Complete build process testing

### 2025-05-19 14:21
- Successfully converted all scripts to CommonJS format
- Asset generation scripts working correctly
- Successfully built ZIP package with electron-forge
- DMG creation pending due to appdmg dependency issues

## Current Issues
1. Module system compatibility:
   - ESM vs CommonJS conflicts
   - `__dirname` not defined in ES modules
   - Need to update script syntax
2. Build process:
   - Asset generation scripts need CommonJS conversion
   - Build process failing due to module issues
   - Need to verify icon generation in build pipeline
