# [TASK005] - Basic App Structure

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-19  
**Updated:** 2025-05-22

## Original Request
Implement basic application structure including window management, service container, and event system.

## Thought Process
- Window management system needs to handle state persistence and macOS-specific features
- Service container should support dependency injection and singleton services
- Event system must handle IPC communication between main and renderer processes
- Need type-safe implementation throughout

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Window Management System
   - Implement WindowManager class
   - Add state persistence
   - Handle macOS-specific window behavior
   
2. ✅ Service Container
   - Create service container with DI support
   - Implement singleton pattern support
   - Add type-safe service registration

3. ✅ Event System
   - Create event emitter interface
   - Implement event handling system
   - Add IPC bridge for cross-process communication
   - Integrate with service container

4. ✅ UI Framework Setup
   - Create basic layout components
   - Set up state management
   - Integrate with services
   - Implement responsive design

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
