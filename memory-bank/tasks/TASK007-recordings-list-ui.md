# [TASK007] - Recordings List UI with Sidebar

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Updated:** 2025-05-23

## Original Request
Implement a sidebar UI to display all recordings with their datetime, allowing users to see a list of all their recorded audio files.

## Thought Process
The user wants to see all recordings in the app with their recording datetime. After discussing options, we decided on a sidebar UI layout that:
- Keeps recording controls as the main focus
- Provides easy access to recordings list on the left
- Groups recordings by relative dates (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
- Shows recording time, duration, and file size
- Allows for future enhancements like playback and deletion

## Implementation Plan
1. Update StorageService to implement listRecordings() method
2. Create IPC handlers for storage operations
3. Build sidebar components (Sidebar, RecordingsList, RecordingItem)
4. Update AppContainer with new sidebar layout
5. Style components to match existing design
6. Add real-time updates when recordings complete
7. Test the complete flow
