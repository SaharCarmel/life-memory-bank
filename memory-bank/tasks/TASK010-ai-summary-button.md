# [TASK010] - Add AI Summary Button to Recordings

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Updated:** 2025-05-23

## Original Request
Add a button to recordings for AI summary generation.

## Thought Process
The user wanted to add AI summary functionality to recordings. Based on the existing codebase analysis, I found that:

1. AI processing infrastructure was already in place (AIService, AI handlers)
2. Transcription functionality existed as a reference pattern
3. The RecordingItem component needed to be extended with AI functionality
4. Type definitions needed to include AI-related fields

The approach was to mirror the transcription functionality pattern but for AI processing.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Expose AI methods in preload script
- [x] Update type definitions to include AI fields
- [x] Add AI event listeners to RecordingItem component
- [x] Add AI summary button and menu items
- [x] Add AI status indicators and progress tracking
- [x] Implement AI processing handlers

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
