# [TASK013] - Update Recording List UI

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Updated:** 2025-05-23

## Original Request
Update the recording list to look like the provided image with AI titles as primary display, cleaner layout, and improved visual design.

## Thought Process
Based on the provided UI mockup image, the new design should have:

1. **AI Title as Primary**: Display the AI-generated title (e.g., "100x draft driver dod2") as the main text instead of timestamp
2. **Date Grouping with Icons**: Show relative dates like "Yesterday" with speech bubble icon ðŸ’¬
3. **Time on Right**: Display just the time (e.g., "10:59") aligned to the right
4. **Cleaner Layout**: Darker background, minimal design with better typography
5. **Fallback Display**: If no AI title exists, show timestamp as before

This requires updating both the RecordingItem component and its CSS to match the new design while maintaining all existing functionality (progress bars, menus, etc.).

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Update RecordingItem.tsx to prioritize AI title display
- [x] Modify time/date display logic to show time on right side
- [x] Update RecordingsList.tsx date grouping to use relative dates with icons
- [x] Redesign RecordingItem.module.css for cleaner, darker styling
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility for recordings without AI titles
- [x] Test responsive behavior with long titles

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
