# [TASK014] - Import External Recordings

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Updated:** 2025-05-26

## Original Request
Add the ability to load external recordings from the user's file system into VoiceMCP for transcription and AI processing.

## Thought Process
Currently, VoiceMCP only works with recordings made within the app. Users should be able to import existing audio files (meetings, interviews, lectures, etc.) to leverage the transcription and AI summary features.

The implementation needs to:
1. **File Selection**: Provide multiple ways to import (file picker, drag-and-drop)
2. **Format Support**: Handle common audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WebM)
3. **File Processing**: Copy files to VoiceMCP storage structure, generate metadata
4. **Integration**: Make imported files work seamlessly with existing transcription/AI features
5. **User Experience**: Clear progress indication, error handling, file validation

Key considerations:
- File size limits (large files may impact performance)
- Audio format conversion if needed for consistency
- Metadata extraction (duration, format, bitrate)
- Storage organization alongside recorded files

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Add import button to main UI
- [x] Implement file picker dialog with audio format filters
- [x] Create file validation and metadata extraction logic
- [x] Implement file copying to VoiceMCP storage structure
- [x] Add progress indication for import process
- [x] Update StorageService to handle imported files
- [x] Create comprehensive AudioImportService
- [x] Add IPC handlers for import operations
- [x] Update frontend preload interfaces
- [x] Style import button and integrate with UI

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
