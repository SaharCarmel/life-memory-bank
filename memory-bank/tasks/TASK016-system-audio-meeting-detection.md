# [TASK016] - System Audio Capture & Meeting Detection

**Status:** Blocked - On Hold  
**Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Updated:** 2025-05-26

## Original Request
Implement system audio capture combined with microphone recording to detect and record meetings. The app should monitor system audio activity and prompt users when a potential meeting is detected.

## Current Status - STASHED
**Task has been put on hold due to macOS Screen Recording permission issues.** All implementation work has been stashed in git.

**Git Stash Reference:** `TASK016: Meeting Mode Implementation - Stashed for permission issues`

**Issue:** The screen recording permission dialog is not properly granting permissions, causing the meeting mode to fail with "Screen recording permission required for meeting mode" error.

**To Recover Work:**
```bash
cd voice-mcp
git stash list  # Find the stash
git stash apply stash@{0}  # Apply the most recent stash
```

## Implementation Status Before Stashing

### ‚úÖ Completed Components (75% of backend implementation)
1. **SystemAudioService** - Real FFmpeg-based system audio capture via ScreenCaptureKit
2. **AudioMixer** - Dual-channel audio mixing (microphone + system audio)
3. **MeetingDetector** - Threshold-based meeting detection with macOS notifications
4. **AudioService Extensions** - Meeting mode methods and integration
5. **UI Integration** - Meeting mode toggle and controls in RecordingControls.tsx

## Thought Process
This is the core foundation for meeting recording functionality. The implementation needs to:

1. **Dual Audio Capture**: Record both system audio (meeting participants) and microphone (user's voice)
2. **Meeting Detection**: Monitor audio patterns to identify potential meetings vs music/videos
3. **User Interaction**: Prompt user when meeting activity is detected
4. **macOS Integration**: Use ScreenCaptureKit API for system audio capture
5. **Permission Handling**: Manage screen recording and microphone permissions
6. **Privacy-First Approach**: Comprehensive privacy safeguards and user control

### User Requirements (Clarified 2025-05-23)
- **Audio Format**: WebM/Opus (same as microphone), 128kbps
- **Detection Strategy**: Conservative (miss some rather than false positives)
- **User Notifications**: macOS system notifications 
- **Recording Behavior**: Always ask user before starting (no auto-record)
- **Privacy**: Comprehensive privacy controls and safeguards

### Technical Architecture

#### Audio Pipeline
```
System Audio (ScreenCaptureKit) ‚Üí Privacy Filter ‚Üí Meeting Detector
Microphone (MediaRecorder) ‚Üí Audio Mixer ‚Üí Dual-Channel Recording
```

#### Meeting Detection Flow
1. **Audio Monitoring**: Background system audio analysis
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Detect conversational patterns (75%+ confidence)
3. **User Notification**: macOS system notification with meeting context
4. **User Choice**: Start Recording / Dismiss / Never for this app
5. **Recording**: Dual-channel recording with visual indicators

#### Privacy Architecture
- **Application Filtering**: Blacklist sensitive apps (banking, password managers)
- **Content Detection**: Pause during password fields and sensitive forms
- **Local Processing**: No cloud transmission of system audio
- **Encryption**: In-memory audio stream encryption
- **Visual Indicators**: Always show when system audio is active
- **Data Control**: Easy deletion, export, and retention controls

### Key Technical Challenges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKER**: macOS requires Screen Recording permission for system audio
- Audio synchronization between system and microphone streams
- Pattern recognition for meeting vs non-meeting audio (conservative approach)
- Resource management for longer recordings
- Privacy filtering of sensitive applications and content
- Real-time audio processing without performance impact

## Debugging Notes for Resume

### Permission Issue Analysis
```
Permission status check: { screenStatus: 'denied', microphoneStatus: 'granted' }
Screen recording permission not granted, showing dialog
Opening System Preferences for permission
Permission status check: { screenStatus: 'denied', microphoneStatus: 'granted' }
Updated permissions after dialog: { screenRecording: false, microphone: true }
```

### Potential Solutions to Try
1. **Development Build Issue**: Test with production build
2. **App Bundle ID**: Verify correct bundle identifier in permissions
3. **Permission Reset**: Use `tccutil reset ScreenCapture` to reset permissions
4. **Manual Grant**: Manually add app to System Preferences ‚Üí Screen Recording
5. **Alternative Approach**: Investigate other system audio capture methods
