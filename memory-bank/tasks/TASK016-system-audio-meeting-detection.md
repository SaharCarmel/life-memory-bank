# [TASK016] - System Audio Capture & Meeting Detection

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Updated:** 2025-05-23

## Original Request
Implement system audio capture combined with microphone recording to detect and record meetings. The app should monitor system audio activity and prompt users when a potential meeting is detected.

## Thought Process
This is the core foundation for meeting recording functionality. The implementation needs to:

1. **Dual Audio Capture**: Record both system audio (meeting participants) and microphone (user's voice)
2. **Meeting Detection**: Monitor audio patterns to identify potential meetings vs music/videos
3. **User Interaction**: Prompt user when meeting activity is detected
4. **macOS Integration**: Use ScreenCaptureKit API for system audio capture
5. **Permission Handling**: Manage screen recording and microphone permissions
6. **Privacy-First Approach**: Comprehensive privacy safeguards and user control

### User Requirements (Clarified 2025-05-23)
- **Audio Format**: WebM/Opus (same as microphone), 128kbps
- **Detection Strategy**: Conservative (miss some rather than false positives)
- **User Notifications**: macOS system notifications 
- **Recording Behavior**: Always ask user before starting (no auto-record)
- **Privacy**: Comprehensive privacy controls and safeguards

### Technical Architecture

#### Audio Pipeline
```
System Audio (ScreenCaptureKit) ‚Üí Privacy Filter ‚Üí Meeting Detector
Microphone (MediaRecorder) ‚Üí Audio Mixer ‚Üí Dual-Channel Recording
```

#### Meeting Detection Flow
1. **Audio Monitoring**: Background system audio analysis
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Detect conversational patterns (75%+ confidence)
3. **User Notification**: macOS system notification with meeting context
4. **User Choice**: Start Recording / Dismiss / Never for this app
5. **Recording**: Dual-channel recording with visual indicators

#### Privacy Architecture
- **Application Filtering**: Blacklist sensitive apps (banking, password managers)
- **Content Detection**: Pause during password fields and sensitive forms
- **Local Processing**: No cloud transmission of system audio
- **Encryption**: In-memory audio stream encryption
- **Visual Indicators**: Always show when system audio is active
- **Data Control**: Easy deletion, export, and retention controls

### Key Technical Challenges
- macOS requires Screen Recording permission for system audio
- Audio synchronization between system and microphone streams
- Pattern recognition for meeting vs non-meeting audio (conservative approach)
- Resource management for longer recordings
- Privacy filtering of sensitive applications and content
- Real-time audio processing without performance impact

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Privacy Foundation (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Create privacy settings system and UI
- [ ] Implement app detection and filtering logic
- [ ] Add visual recording indicators (menu bar, dock badge)
- [ ] Set up secure audio buffer management with encryption
- [ ] Design permission request flow with clear explanations

### Phase 2: System Audio Capture (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Research and integrate ScreenCaptureKit API
- [ ] Create SystemAudioService for audio capture
- [ ] Handle macOS Screen Recording permissions
- [ ] Implement secure audio streaming with privacy filters
- [ ] Test basic system audio capture functionality

### Phase 3: Audio Processing & Mixing (Days 5-6)
- [ ] Create AudioMixer service for dual-channel recording
- [ ] Implement audio synchronization between system and mic
- [ ] Handle timing, buffering, and clock drift issues
- [ ] Ensure WebM/Opus output format compatibility
- [ ] Test with various audio scenarios and latency

### Phase 4: Meeting Detection (Days 7-8)
- [ ] Create MeetingDetector with conservative algorithms
- [ ] Implement speech pattern analysis (300-3000 Hz range)
- [ ] Add conversation detection (30-second buffer, speaker changes)
- [ ] Filter out media playback patterns (music, videos)
- [ ] Achieve 75%+ confidence threshold for detection

### Phase 5: Notification System (Days 9-10)
- [ ] Integrate with macOS notification center
- [ ] Design contextual notification content
- [ ] Implement quick actions (Start/Dismiss/Settings)
- [ ] Add smart timing (notify during conversation lulls)
- [ ] Handle notification preferences and permissions

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing (Days 11-12)
- [ ] Update existing recording UI for meeting mode
- [ ] Integrate with current RecorderService architecture
- [ ] Add meeting-specific metadata and naming
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with real meeting platforms
- [ ] Performance optimization and error handling
