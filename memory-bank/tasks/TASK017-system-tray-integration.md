# [TASK017] - System Tray Integration

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-05-23  
**Updated:** 2025-05-23

## Original Request
Implement system tray functionality to provide quick access to meeting recording controls and status indicators without requiring the main window to be open.

## Thought Process
The system tray is crucial for meeting recording functionality because:

1. **Always Available**: Users need quick access to recording controls during meetings
2. **Status Visibility**: Clear indication of current recording state
3. **Minimal Interruption**: Tray interactions don't disrupt the meeting window
4. **Quick Actions**: Start/stop recording, meeting mode toggle, open main app

**System Tray States:**
- **Gray**: Monitoring for meetings (idle)
- **Yellow**: Meeting detected, awaiting user action
- **Red**: Recording in progress with timer
- **Green**: Processing/transcribing completed recording
- **Blue**: Meeting mode manually enabled

**Tray Menu Structure:**
```
ðŸŽ¤ VoiceMCP
â”œâ”€â”€ Meeting Mode: [On/Off]
â”œâ”€â”€ Recording: [Start/Stop] (00:05:23)
â”œâ”€â”€ â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
â”œâ”€â”€ Quick Record
â”œâ”€â”€ Open Main Window
â”œâ”€â”€ Settings
â”œâ”€â”€ â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
â””â”€â”€ Quit
```
