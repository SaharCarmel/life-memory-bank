# [TASK020] - Real-Time Transcription During Recording

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-05-24  
**Updated:** 2025-05-25

## Original Request
Implement real-time transcription while recording for long recordings using local Whisper processing. The feature should provide immediate feedback as the user speaks, with fast updates and automatic corrections, integrated into the existing recording flow.

## Thought Process
This feature addresses the need for immediate transcription feedback during long recordings like meetings, interviews, or lectures. The implementation will:

- Process audio in 5-second chunks with 1-second overlap for context continuity
- Use local Whisper (tiny/base model) for fast processing while maintaining privacy
- Implement smart segment merging to handle overlapping chunks
- Provide a streaming architecture that processes chunks in parallel with recording
- Store transcript segments in real-time for immediate access and recovery

**Technical Approach:**
- Extend RecorderService to emit audio chunks for processing
- Create RealTimeTranscriptionService for chunk management and processing
- Develop Python streaming worker for efficient Whisper processing
- Implement intelligent transcript segment merging algorithm
- Add real-time storage and UI updates (UI as lower priority)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- 5-second chunks with 1-second overlap for optimal speed/accuracy balance
- Use tiny/base Whisper models for real-time performance
- Process chunks in parallel to avoid blocking recording
- Smart merging algorithm using edit distance for overlapping segments
- Maintain full recording file while building transcript incrementally

## Implementation Plan
Full implementation with comprehensive subtasks covering all aspects of real-time transcription functionality.

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 95%
