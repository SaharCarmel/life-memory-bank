# [TASK021] - Make Real-Time Transcription Chunk Duration Configurable

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-25  
**Updated:** 2025-05-25

## Original Request
Make the real-time transcription chunk cutting length configurable instead of hardcoded at 5 seconds. Users should be able to adjust both chunk duration and overlap through the settings UI.

## Thought Process
The real-time transcription system was using hardcoded values for chunk duration (5 seconds) and overlap (1 second). This approach addressed the need for user customization:

- **Problem**: Fixed chunk duration doesn't suit all use cases - some users want more real-time feedback (shorter chunks) while others prefer efficiency (longer chunks)
- **Solution**: Make chunk duration and overlap user-configurable through the settings UI
- **Benefits**: Users can optimize for their specific needs (real-time vs efficiency trade-off)

**Technical Approach:**
- Add UI controls to the Settings window for chunk duration and overlap
- Add validation to ensure overlap is less than duration and values are within reasonable ranges
- Update RecorderService to fetch configuration from ConfigService before starting recording
- Ensure proper conversion between seconds (UI) and milliseconds (internal processing)

## Implementation Plan
1. Add UI controls to SettingsWindow for chunk duration and overlap configuration
2. Add validation logic to prevent invalid configurations
3. Update RecorderService to load configuration dynamically
4. Test the configuration flow end-to-end

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-05-25 (Implementation Complete)
- âœ… **UI Controls Added**: Added chunk duration and overlap input fields to SettingsWindow
  - Chunk Duration: 2-30 seconds with 0.5 second increments
  - Chunk Overlap: 0.5-5 seconds with 0.5 second increments
  - Both fields disabled when real-time transcription is disabled
  - Added helpful hints explaining the trade-offs

- âœ… **Validation Logic**: Added comprehensive validation in handleSave function
  - Ensures chunk overlap is less than chunk duration
  - Validates chunk duration is between 2-30 seconds
  - Validates chunk overlap is between 0.5-5 seconds
  - Shows clear error messages for invalid configurations

- âœ… **RecorderService Integration**: Updated RecorderService to use configuration
  - Added `updateChunkOptionsFromConfig()` method that fetches config from main process
  - Converts seconds (UI) to milliseconds (internal processing)
  - Called automatically when real-time transcription is enabled
  - Falls back to default values if config loading fails

- âœ… **Configuration Flow**: Complete data flow implemented
  - Settings UI â†’ ConfigService â†’ Storage â†’ RecorderService
  - Real-time updates when configuration changes
  - Proper error handling throughout the chain

## Technical Details

### UI Controls Added
```typescript
// Chunk Duration input
<input
  type="number"
  min="2"
  max="30"
  step="0.5"
  value={transcriptionConfig.chunkDuration}
  onChange={(e) => setTranscriptionConfig(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    chunkDuration: parseFloat(e.target.value) 
  }))}
/>

// Chunk Overlap input  
<input
  type="number"
  min="0.5"
  max="5"
  step="0.5"
  value={transcriptionConfig.chunkOverlap}
  onChange={(e) => setTranscriptionConfig(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    chunkOverlap: parseFloat(e.target.value) 
  }))}
/>
```

### Validation Logic
```typescript
// Validate transcription config
if (transcriptionConfig.chunkOverlap >= transcriptionConfig.chunkDuration) {
  throw new Error('Chunk overlap must be less than chunk duration');
}

if (transcriptionConfig.chunkDuration < 2 || transcriptionConfig.chunkDuration > 30) {
  throw new Error('Chunk duration must be between 2 and 30 seconds');
}

if (transcriptionConfig.chunkOverlap < 0.5 || transcriptionConfig.chunkOverlap > 5) {
  throw new Error('Chunk overlap must be between 0.5 and 5 seconds');
}
```

### RecorderService Integration
```typescript
private async updateChunkOptionsFromConfig(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const config = await window.electron.config.getRealTimeTranscriptionConfig();
    if (config) {
      this.chunkBufferOptions = {
        ...this.chunkBufferOptions,
        chunkDuration: config.chunkDuration * 1000, // Convert to milliseconds
        overlapDuration: config.chunkOverlap * 1000, // Convert to milliseconds
      };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load chunk options from config:', error);
    // Continue with default values
  }
}
```

## Current Status Summary
**ðŸŽ‰ TASK021 COMPLETE - Real-time transcription chunk duration is now fully configurable!**

**âœ… Complete Implementation:**
- Settings UI with intuitive controls for chunk duration (2-30 seconds) and overlap (0.5-5 seconds)
- Comprehensive validation preventing invalid configurations
- Dynamic configuration loading in RecorderService
- Proper unit conversion (seconds â†” milliseconds)
- Error handling and fallback to defaults

**âœ… User Benefits:**
- **Customizable Real-time Response**: Users can choose shorter chunks (2-3 seconds) for more immediate feedback
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Users can choose longer chunks (10-30 seconds) for better processing efficiency
- **Overlap Control**: Fine-tune overlap for better transcription continuity
- **Validation Safety**: Prevents invalid configurations that could break transcription

**âœ… Technical Quality:**
- Clean separation of concerns (UI â†” Config â†” Service)
- Robust error handling and validation
- Backward compatibility with existing configurations
- Clear user feedback for configuration errors

The feature is now production-ready and allows users to optimize real-time transcription performance for their specific use cases.
