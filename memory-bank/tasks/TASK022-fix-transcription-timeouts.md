# [TASK022] - Fix Transcription Timeouts and Improve Reliability

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-26  
**Updated:** 2025-05-26

## Original Request
Fix transcription timeout failures where jobs show progress (66-76%) but then fail with "Transcription timed out" error. The current 5-minute hardcoded timeout is insufficient for longer recordings and the timeout logic doesn't account for actual processing requirements.

## Thought Process
Analysis of the timeout issue reveals several problems:

1. **Fixed Timeout Problem**: 5-minute hardcoded timeout doesn't scale with recording length
2. **Progress vs Reality Mismatch**: Progress shows 76% but job still times out, indicating disconnect between estimation and actual completion
3. **Poor Process Management**: Python workers may hang without proper termination handling
4. **Resource Constraints**: Long recordings may hit memory/CPU limits causing slowdowns
5. **No Retry Logic**: Single timeout failure kills the entire transcription job

**Root Cause**: The timeout system was designed for short recordings and doesn't adapt to longer content or varying system performance.

**Solution Strategy**:
- Dynamic timeout calculation based on audio duration and model complexity
- Enhanced monitoring and heartbeat system for Python workers
- Intelligent retry logic with fallback to faster models
- Better resource management and cleanup
- Progressive timeout warnings and extension capabilities

## Implementation Plan
Comprehensive fix addressing timeout calculation, process management, and reliability.

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 60%

## Progress Log
### 2025-05-26
- Task created to address transcription timeout failures
- Analyzed root causes: fixed timeout, poor process management, no retry logic
- Defined comprehensive solution strategy with dynamic timeouts and intelligent retry
- Created detailed implementation plan with 10 subtasks

**MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
- ✅ **Dynamic Timeout Calculation**: Implemented calculateTimeout() method that estimates audio duration from file size and calculates appropriate timeout based on Whisper model speed factors
- ✅ **Enhanced Configuration**: Added comprehensive timeout options (timeoutMultiplier, minTimeout, maxTimeout, enableRetry, retryWithFasterModel)
- ✅ **Model Speed Factors**: Added processing speed constants for all Whisper models (tiny: 5x, base: 3x, small: 2x, medium: 1.5x, large: 1x, turbo: 2.5x)
- ✅ **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Implemented retryWithFallbackModel() with model hierarchy fallback chain (large→medium→small→base→tiny)
- ✅ **Process Management**: Added signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT) for graceful Python worker shutdown
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed timeout calculation logging showing file size, duration estimates, and final timeout values

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Dynamic timeout scales with audio file duration and model complexity
- 3x safety multiplier with configurable min (1 min) and max (30 min) bounds
- Automatic retry with faster models on timeout (large→medium→small→base→tiny)
- Graceful process termination with proper signal handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging timeout issues

**Current Status**: Core timeout and retry functionality is complete and should resolve the majority of timeout failures. The system now adapts to longer recordings and provides intelligent fallback options.
