# [TASK024] - Fix TypeScript Build Errors and Complete Successful Build

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-05-26  
**Updated:** 2025-05-26

## Original Request
Fix the build errors and make the build happen successfully.

## Thought Process
The user requested to run the build and make it work. I identified that there were TypeScript compilation errors preventing a successful build:

1. Unused variable `transcriptionConfig` in WhisperService.ts
2. Unused parameter `options` in AudioImportService.ts

The approach was to:
1. Fix the TypeScript errors by removing unused variables/parameters
2. Run the build process to verify success
3. Commit the changes and update documentation

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Identify and fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Remove unused variable in WhisperService.ts
- [x] Prefix unused parameter with underscore in AudioImportService.ts
- [x] Run the build process to verify success
- [x] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [x] Update memory bank and tasks

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
